# AI Opportunities at Spitfire

Hi Marc, hi Christian,

Thank you again for your time yesterday – it was great to meet you both.

As promised, I’ve attached three short pieces that showcase how I approach AI: small, assistive systems that enhance existing workflows while maintaining human control for decision making.

1. **Adam Phillips – AI Consultant:** who I am and my approach: *Understand first → start with low-risk wins → prove value → scale → high-value systems*.
2. **Case Study – AI-Assisted Marketing (Auditel UK Franchise Partner):** extracts customer data from their website and internal sources, recommends the right service and case study, drafts emails for approval, and is now being positioned at the franchisor level to strengthen cross-selling.
3. **Example RAG Agent workflow (customer enquiries):** an AI assistant that can respond to a request by retrieving the right information from various sources (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), draft responses for review, and log every action for audit/SLA reporting – similar to what highways teams do.

Since Spitfire’s work spans **strategy → implementation → coaching**, here are three examples of how this style of AI could sit naturally inside your delivery model:

1. **Engagement & Case Assistant (RAG over Spitfire material)**  
   Analyse a selection of files, read a client’s website, or any available data source. Retrieve relevant proposals, reports or case studies from past work. Draft a report/proposal with source links and citations.  
   *Value:* less prep time for consultants, more consistent messaging across sectors, easier executive briefings.  
   *Guardrails:* read-only ingestion, consultant reviews/approves.  
   *Aim:* reduce first-draft prep from 30–60 minutes to under 5.

2. **Performance / KPI Briefing Narrator**  
   Ingest dashboards and recent notes to generate a concise, auditable briefing, highlighting changes, identifying risks, and proposing actions.  
   *Value:* faster prep, clearer communications, aligns with your “measurable delivery” ethos.  
   *Guardrails:* drafts only, human sign-off, logged outputs.  
   *Aim:* extract key facts and metrics in minutes to help identify causes.

3. **Automate or accelerate time-consuming, repetitive tasks**  
   AI can be applied flexibly across use cases and works best when it’s connected to existing systems with good data.  
   I can propose a few pilots and quick wins once I understand Spitfire in more detail.

I’d be happy to spend a week with you (no cost) to map 2–3 specific opportunities like these, finishing with a short conversation with you about them.

Would you be open to a short follow-up next week to review and decide where it makes most sense to start from your side?

Best regards,  
Adam
