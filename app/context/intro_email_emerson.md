Subject: AI potential at Emerson

Hi Marcin,

I hope you're doing well.

I'm Adam Phillips, an AI consultant who recently earned IBM's Professional Certification in Retrieval Augmented Generation and Agentic AI. I now help organisations design AI systems that drive measurable business value.

McKinsey's latest research shows that the AI performance gap is widening; leaders now outperform laggards by 3.8x in productivity, up from 2.7x in the previous study. This reinforces the opportunity for companies like Emerson to leverage AI for sustainable competitive advantage.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss AI's potential with Emerson – including any challenges you believe AI could assist with, and where there may be potential to realise value.

Potential opportunities might include:

- AI awareness sessions for members of your team  
- Addressing specific operational challenges where AI may help  
- Developing proposals for high-value AI use cases within Emerson's operations  

The goal is to identify high-impact opportunities aligned with Emerson's strategic objectives.

Would you be open to a 30-minute conversation next week to explore this? I'm happy to adapt to your schedule or send a few suggested times.

Best regards,
