Subject: In-person workshop: champions & quick wins (problem-first)

Hi Marcin,

Thanks again for the call today, it gave me a clear direction. As discussed, I propose a short **in-person, interactive** session that keeps us **problem-first and technology-second**, aimed at practical, in-context improvements for Crawley.

## Vision

Free up time from low-value, repetitive checks so the team focuses on higher-value decisions. Catching an issue **upstream** can be **1 unit of time**; if it reaches a customer, it can become **100 units**. We'll prioritise the prevent-not-cure fixes that compound, and build momentum via quick wins and champions in each area.

## How we'll run it (90 mins – 2 hours, ~5 people)

1. **Examples → your context**  
   Brief case studies (manufacturing and beyond) to show what's reliably possible now. After each, we'll map where it fits at Emerson.

   **For example, I’ll run through slides on how AI could:**

   - **Spot dispatch risks early** with a small rules + LLM co-pilot that highlights likely cut-off misses with **reasons** and proposes next actions for human sign-off.  
   - **Explain test logs with citations** using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over specs, calibration, and functional test logs to draft a concession or Non-Conformance Report for Quality Assurance approval.  
   - **Assemble traceability packs on demand** by semantically searching files/records, answering “show all artefacts for SN 123” with citations and producing an audit-ready pack.

   *(No live data or system access needed for this session. The aim is concepts and where they help today.)*

2. **Assist, not replace:**  
   AI drafts; humans review/approve; decisions (and why) are logged so the process can improve continuously.

3. **Interactive mapping:**  
   Where this applies today, what it saves per person (day/week), and who would champion the improvement.

4. **Champions & Quick wins:**  
   Identify one or two champions and select a couple of quick wins with clear **6-week goals** and success metrics.

## Measures to agree in the room

Hours back per week • fewer dispatch cut-offs/rework • first-pass approval rate • audit-pack prep time • traceability completeness.

## Guardrails

No AI in control/decision loops; **read-only** access for any data; **human-in-the-loop** approvals; full auditability.

## Deliverables

Slides, a 1-page opportunity list (ranked by Impact × Feasibility), and a shortlist of quick wins with owners and agreed 6-week metrics.

## Commercials

- **Introductory rate: £240/day (8h) = £30/h for the first 3 months** from our agreed start date (25% discount). Thereafter **£320/day (8h) = £40/h**. I'm happy to **estimate and cap** days.  
- **Workshop cap (so costs are clear now):**

  - **Option A (90 min, cap 1 day total → £240):**  
    Includes slides, facilitation, and live mapping. After the session, you get a PDF of the slides and a short email recap with **key opportunities** and **2 quick-win candidates** captured in the room.

  - **Option B (2 hours, cap 1.5 days total → £360):**  
    Includes a **30-minute pre-call** to tailor content **one week before delivery** and a **1-page ranked opportunity list** plus **two draft pilot briefs** (problem, scope, success metric, guardrails, data source, owner, capped day estimate) for review post-delivery.

- **Payment:** corporate card via secure FreeAgent link.  
- **Logistics:** on-site at Crawley; no travel expenses within 40 miles (covers Crawley).

## Questions & next steps

- Please confirm audience size and roles (I have down 5 people: you, Supply Chain Manager, Quality Manager, Customer Care Manager, Sales Manager?).  
- Please confirm the spelling of **"Rike"**, I believe you said production teams used this for the timesheet, etc.? I couldn't find it online; most likely, I misheard.  
- Is an external laptop + internet OK, and is it fine to share materials afterwards as a PDF by email?  
- Availability: I can hold a few time-slots in the week beginning 10th November if that helps – perhaps **Tue 12 Nov 10:00–12:00**, or **Thu 14 Nov 14:00–16:00**; happy to work around diaries.

Thank you very much. If you have any questions for me, please let me know.

Best regards,  
Adam
